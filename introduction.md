## Welcome to Frame Bot :robot_face:
<p>Frame Bot is a gpt 3.5 powered ai designed to answer all of your street fighter 6 questions.<br>
This can be anything from game mechanics to specific frame data or character specific combos.<p>

This is a work in progress so if you run into any issues please let me know here ->

---

## FAQ
### How does Frame bot work?
You can enter any street fighter 6 related question into the chat and frame bot will give you an answer.

**Feel free to give it specific questions related to different characters or even character interactions ie: 'What is the best way to punish Ryu's heavy dragon punch with Ken?'**

### Why does it take so long to answer my question?
Depending on the question it can take a bit for the ai to comprehend the question and answer correctly. Please have patience with this work in progress bot. We will be looking for more ways to improve the answers and the time it takes to get them!

### Can I change my avatar?
We are working on being able to change the avatars for the chatter and the bot.
