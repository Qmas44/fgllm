Active
The period of time that a move has a hitbox and is capable of doing damage to the opponent. It's one of the three stages of an attack, along with startup and recovery, and is measured in frames. 
After your move undergoes some brief startup (the windup phase), then the active period starts, where your character's fist is finally able to connect with your friend's jaw. 
Then, you have to suffer the recovery (the cooldown phase) before you can move again.
